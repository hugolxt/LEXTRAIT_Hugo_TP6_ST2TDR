## EXERCICE 1 : Some questions about the code ##
#### Question 1: What is clean code? What is the role played by refactoring one’s code?

Having a clean code is an essential thing because it allows a simple and fast understanding of the program objective. This is especially valid when the code we produce is shared between several people, the structure of the code must be clear and well explained so that the objective of the program is not misunderstood. Refactoring a clean code is pretty interesting a have the objectiv to optimise the structure of the code (being cleaner) while keeping the essence of the project. The application must have the initial functionalities

#### Question 2: Do you think you can “over-refactor” and do too much? How?

Refactoring the code is very interesting because it allows possible optimizations to the processes of the applications. Now, it is necessary to be careful not to lose sight of the essence of the project. If in the end the modifications are too important and we don't recognize the project, then we may be too far from the original idea. 

#### Question 3: What is a code smell? Why should you bother?

The smell of the code represents the aura that the code gives off; indeed many small problems within a code will disturb the comprehesion and the functioning of the program. it can be compared to white noise in a recording. It disturbs the global understanding of the application.

#### Question 4: Can you identify a few code smells in the original GuildedRose?

In the Guilded Rose application the methods that we needed to refactor last week was totaly smelling with 35 nested strcutures like if statment. It altere the comprehension of the code...

#### Question 5: What are some refactoring techniques you could have used in the GuildedRose?

1. Simplify variable name
2. Delete useless variables and methods
3. Move code into news classes
4. Move code into news methods
5. Try to simplify nested structure and conditions

## EXERCICE 2 : Now get to the other part of this website, under “Design Patterns”. You’ll discover incredible mechanism used to build robust software that are used through-out the world. ##

#### Question 1: In simple terms, and a few sentencesat most, what’s a design pattern?

Design pattern can be understand as Blueprint. It's a generic template that allows to simplify the creation and the instanciation of specific objects in applications. That's allow the application to instanciate object really easily and manage them really quiclky.
We should use design patterns we the application need to intanciate a lot of differents objects all based on the same inheritance. We can create preinitialized objetcs for the application through classes managment. That simplify the objetc's construction

#### Question 2: Write  a  small  program  that  build  a pizza  with  various  toppings  using  the builder pattern. Why is this a good idea?Thinkabout scalability for instance

This is a really good idea because we can intanciate a lot of already defined objects. That's simplify a lot of thing when we need to generate new personalized objects based on the same model {Blueprint}.

#### Question 3: Find an original idea to implement a decorator pattern (not the one from the website). Can you think of any limitations? No need to code here.

We can think of an idea of a car dealer that could allow users to add options to the car. This way it would be quite easy to design and build the car with all the different extras requested by the user. Models would then be available for pre-sale and also in blueprint form (pattern).

#### Question 4:	Write  a  small  program  to  implement  the behavioral design  pattern  of  your  choice
